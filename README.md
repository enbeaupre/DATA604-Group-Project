### Authors: Elise Beaupre and Thanusha Balasubramanian.  

#### Project Description  
All 5 datasets contain information licensed under the Open Government Licence – City of Calgary which allows public usage of the data.  

This project examined the question of which Calgary communities are the most ideal for homeownership by integrating residential property assessments, crime statistics, and community amenities using City of Calgary open data. Through structured SQL analysis and cross-dataset joins, we demonstrated that property value, safety, and access to amenities interact in complex and non-linear ways.  

All datasets used contain information licensed under the Open Government Licence – City of Calgary which allows public usage of the data.
